# Chrome extension and site plugin

## About
In this repo is a web3 solution for using a [MoneyStream](https://github.com/ibrica/money-stream-program) Solana Sealevel smart contract. Still in development, not ready for testing!

## Get started

Clone this repository, and then, in this directory:

1. `npm install`
2. `npx webpack`

Your unpacked Chrome extension will be compiled into `dist/`. You can load it into Chrome by enabling developer mode on the "Extensions" page, hitting "Load unpacked", and selecting the `dist/` folder. You can pack the extension into a `.crx` by using the "Pack extension" button on the same page.
